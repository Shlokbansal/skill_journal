 # Reflection — First Skill Journal Commit

Today I:
- Set up SSH with GitHub for password-free pushes
- Created my first skill file: `spark_sql_intro.py`
- Practiced basic Spark operations for healthcare datasets

**Key Learnings:**
- Spark is critical for scaling analytics beyond pandas
- SSH setup makes daily Git commits realistic
- Each commit is not just practice, but a portfolio asset

**How I Felt:**
Proud to see my first commit live on GitHub. This felt like crossing the “setup” barrier — now I can focus purely on adding skills daily.
