# Skill Journal

Daily micro-coaching practice in **MLOps**, **Big Data**, **Cloud**, **Explainable AI**, and **Healthcare NLP** for AI in health tech.

This repository tracks my progress in building **job-ready AI/ML skills** alongside my Masterâ€™s in Data Science program at Northeastern University.  
Each entry includes:
- **Code snippet** demonstrating the skill
- **Real-world health tech/tech company use case**
- **Challenge question** to build critical thinking & communication skills

## Goals by Dec 2025
- Build 5+ runnable MLOps examples  
- Deploy at least 1 mini-project to cloud  
- Complete 10+ big data & streaming scripts  
- Apply explainability & compliance tools to health datasets  
- Maintain 100% commit consistency throughout the semester

##  Why This Repo Exists
This is my **hands-on lab notebook** for bridging the gap between:
- **Coursework** (DataCamp, CS50, Google ML Crash Course)
- **Industry Skills** (deployment, big data, NLP in healthcare)
- **Portfolio Projects** (SurgiSense, wearable data analysis, clinical NLP)

By the end of Fall 2025, this repo will serve as proof that Iâ€™ve gone **beyond the classroom** to gain applied, job-relevant skills.
